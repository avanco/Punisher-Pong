; Kirk Israel words:
; OK, last little bit of crap to take care of.
; there are two special memory locations, $FFFC and $FFFE
; When the atari starts up, a "reset" is done (which has nothing to do with
; the reset switch on the console!) When this happens, the 6502 looks at
; memory location $FFFC (and by extension its neighbor $FFFD, since it's 
; seaching for both bytes of a full memory address)  and then goes to the 
; location pointed to by $FFFC/$FFFD...so our first .word Start tells DASM
; to put the binary data that we labeled "Start" at the location we established
; with org.  And then we do it again for $FFFE/$FFFF, which is for a special
; event called a BRK which you don't have to worry about now.
